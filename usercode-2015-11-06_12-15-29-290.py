Write out the code:
    def level_1():
        return 'Hello, world!'
The `def hello_world()`, a function definition, tells the computer that all lines of code indented under it are instructions describing how to run the function `level_1()`. The `return 'Hello, world!'` tells the computer to give the text 'Hello, world!' to the program that is tasked with running this code. This text is usually called a string.

"""
Now it's time for variables! A variable in Python is a changeable value stored under a particular name. For example, the variable `foo` might be storing the string 'bar'. We don't have to know what each variable is holding; we can use variable names *without* quotes in place of any string, and the computer will automatically replace the variable name with whatever is stored inside that variable.
You can accept input as a variable (name the variable whatever you want) by putting a variable name inside the parentheses of the function definition.

"""Alright, integers. Integers are numbers, positive, negative, or zero, with no fractional part. In Python, integers are notated by just the number itself; in other words, you don't need quotes or anything, unlike strings. Just like strings, however, integers can be stored in variables. They can also be operated on. For example, `2 + 3` is actually acceptable Python code that evaluates to `5` (`return 2 + 3` will just return `5`).

def level_3(arg):

"""Conditionals! Conditionals, or `if` statements, run different code based on whether something is `True` or `False`. `True` and `False` are actually Python keywords. They are called boolean values. A variable can be assigned a boolean value, so `foo = True` is valid code. An `if` statement is written like so:
    if a:
        <Your code here for if `a` is `True`>
    elif !a:
        <Your code here for if `a` is `False`>
    elif b == 'Hello':
        <Your code here for if `b` is `'Hello'`>
    elif b != 'Hello':
        <Your code here for if `b` is *not* `'Hello'`>
    elif c == 4:
        <Your code here for if `c` is `4`>
    elif c > 5:
        <Your code here for if `c` is greater than `5`>
    elif c <= 3:
        <Your code here for if `c` is less than or equal to `3`>
    elif c != 2:
        <Your code here for if `c` is *not* `2`>
    else:
        <Your code here for if none of the above conditions work>
In this example, `a`, `b`, and `c` are variables. You do not have to include all of these components in an `if` statement, so only check for what is necessary.
